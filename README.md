Most “AI startups” today are just a text box duct-taped to an API call, wrapped in a $2000 landing page, marketed with words like revolutionary, agents, and proprietary intelligence, while the entire backend is a single prompt saying “be helpful.” There is no model, no moat, no innovation — just vibes, a Stripe subscription, and blind faith that users won’t realize they’re paying monthly for something they could do themselves in 30 seconds. If your product collapses the moment OpenAI rate-limits you, you didn’t build a company, you rented confidence. Calling this an “AI startup” is like calling a microwave a restaurant: something heats up, nobody knows how, and somehow you’re charging for it.
