Most “AI startups” today are just a text box duct-taped to an API call, wrapped in a $2000 landing page, marketed with words like revolutionary, agents, and proprietary intelligence, while the entire backend is a single prompt saying “be helpful.” There is no model, no moat, no innovation — just vibes, a Stripe subscription, and blind faith that users won’t realize they’re paying monthly for something they could do themselves in 30 seconds. If your product collapses the moment OpenAI rate-limits you, you didn’t build a company, you rented confidence. Calling this an “AI startup” is like calling a microwave a restaurant: something heats up, nobody knows how, and somehow you’re charging for it.

A public service announcement disguised as a repo.

This repository exists for one reason only:
to roast the ever-living hell out of “AI startups” that are just wrappers.

You know the ones.

What is an “AI startup” (apparently)

A landing page with a gradient

A headline screaming “Powered by AI”

A form

A button

A prompt

Your API key

$29/month

That’s it.
No research. No innovation. No moat. Just vibes.

Congratulations 🎉

If your startup:

calls openai.chat.completions.create()

adds a loading spinner

rebrands “prompt engineering” as “proprietary intelligence”

has a waitlist instead of a product

You didn’t build an AI company.
You built a form with confidence.

The Typical Flow

“We’re building something big”

“Join the waitlist”

“Early access”

“Pricing page”

“AI-powered”

Same prompt everyone else uses

Disappear in 3 months

Speedrun complete.

Fake Features Hall of Fame

“Advanced AI reasoning”
→ temperature = 0.7

“Enterprise-grade AI”
→ same endpoint, different font

“Custom models”
→ prompt.txt

“AI agents”
→ while loop

“Context-aware intelligence”
→ you passed the user input correctly (good job)

Investors, please read this slowly

If the pitch deck says:

“We leverage AI to disrupt…”

And the demo is:

user input → LLM → output

You didn’t fund innovation.
You funded a subscription to someone else’s API.

Founders, this one hurts

If OpenAI changes pricing and your startup dies overnight,
that wasn’t a business — that was a temporary configuration.

This repo

This repo is intentionally:

stupid

minimal

obvious

honest

Because it shows how easy it is to fake an “AI product”.

If this offends you, ask yourself why.

License

Free to use.
Free to fork.
Free to rename.

Just don’t call it “revolutionary”.
